# Machine Learning Assignment – IISER Bhopal

This repository contains my solution code for the Machine Learning assignment (classification task using a synthetic dataset). The code includes data visualization, model training with parameter tuning, evaluation metric implementations, and final label generation for the test data.

## Contents
- Data visualization script  
- Classifier training and grid search  
- Custom implementations of precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score  
- Feature transformation experiment  
- Generated label files for the test dataset  

## Usage
Run the provided Python scripts/notebooks to reproduce the plots and the class labels exactly as submitted.

## Notes
All code follows the assignment guidelines and avoids external libraries for metric computations.
